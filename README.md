- [South Carolina Bond Forms](forms/South-Carolina/BOND-FORMS.md) - South Carolina general and mechanical contractor surety bond forms

## Purpose

This research collection provides examples of contractor bond forms from different states to help understand the various bonding requirements across jurisdictions. These forms are crucial for contractors who need to be licensed in multiple states.

## Research Sources

The following sources were used to collect these bond forms:

1. State contractor licensing board websites:
   - Arizona Registrar of Contractors
   - South Carolina Department of Labor, Licensing and Regulation
   - California Contractors State License Board
   - Nevada State Contractors Board
   - Tennessee Board for Licensing Contractors

2. Public regulatory documents
3. Screenshots of official bond forms

## Navigation

Forms are organized by state in the `forms` directory. Each state folder contains the available bond forms and documentation about that state's requirements.

## Research Challenges

Many contractor licensing websites have security measures that prevent direct access to their forms through automated tools. For comprehensive research, it's recommended to:

1. Contact state licensing boards directly by phone
2. Request current bond forms via official channels
3. Work with a licensed surety bond agency that has access to current forms

## Note

This collection is for reference purposes only. Always obtain the most current version of bond forms directly from the relevant state licensing board when applying for or renewing a contractor's license.
