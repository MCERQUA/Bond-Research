1. **Oregon** - Increased all bond amounts by $5,000 effective January 1, 2024
2. **Washington** - Increasing bond amounts effective July 1, 2024

This suggests that states are updating their requirements to provide stronger consumer protection in today's construction market.

## Next Steps

For comprehensive bond form collection, we recommend:

1. **Direct contact with state licensing boards** to request official bond form samples
2. **Reaching out to surety bond providers** who can provide templates for various states
3. **Focus on priority states** based on Josh's specific business needs
4. **Create a digital archive** of bond forms as they are obtained
5. **Document bond amount requirements** by specific contractor classifications
