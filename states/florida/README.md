# Florida Contractor Bond Forms

## Overview

Florida requires contractors to obtain license bonds as part of their licensing requirements through the Department of Business & Professional Regulation (DBPR).

## Bond Information

Florida contractor license bonds vary by license type and classification. Bonds generally serve to protect consumers from financial harm resulting from a contractor's failure to comply with applicable building codes, standards, or contract terms.

## Access to Forms

Bond forms for Florida contractors can be accessed through the MyFloridaLicense portal maintained by the DBPR. The portal requires navigation through specific license types to access the appropriate bond forms.
