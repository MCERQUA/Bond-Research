# Nevada Contractor Bond Requirements

## Bond Overview

The Nevada State Contractors Board (NSCB) requires contractors to provide a surety bond as part of the licensing process. The bond amount varies based on the monetary limit of the license.

## Bond Amounts

Nevada contractor license bond amounts are determined by the financial limit of the license:

| License Monetary Limit | Bond Amount Required |
|------------------------|----------------------|
| $1,000 - $50,000       | $5,000              |
| $50,001 - $200,000     | $10,000             |
| $200,001 - $500,000    | $20,000             |
| $500,001 - $1,000,000  | $30,000             |
| Over $1,000,000        | $50,000             |
